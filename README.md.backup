# 🐺 THE WOLF PACK

**A continuously-developed trading intelligence system built on collective wisdom, local memory AI, and collaborative development.**

> "January 1, 2026 - the beginning of systematic, collaborative trading research."

---

## ⚠️ WHAT THIS IS (AND ISN'T)

### THIS IS:
- A **real trading system** being developed and tested with actual money
- Built on **50+ years of Market Wizards' wisdom** (PTJ, Livermore, Kovner, Seykota)
- Uses **7 independent intelligence signals** that converge on wounded prey patterns
- Has **self-learning capability** - learns from every trade (wins AND losses)
- Enforces **the 10 Commandments** - rules from the greatest traders, automated
- Continuously developed by a **team of contributors** - not one person
- Built with strong collaboration principles: commitment to each other, building on what came before, honest documentation, and mutual respect

### THIS IS NOT:
- A get-rich-quick scheme
- A promise of guaranteed profits
- Finished (it never will be - continuous development)
- Just one person's project
- Proprietary black box (we share our learnings)

---

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS (January 19, 2026)

**System Version:** v5.6 (Market Wizards' Wisdom Integration Complete)

**All Components OPERATIONAL:**
- ✅ 7-signal convergence engine (scanner v2) - **WORKING**
- ✅ Risk management system (Kelly Criterion) - **WORKING**
- ✅ Livermore Pivotal Point tracker - **WORKING**
- ✅ Self-learning trade analyzer - **WORKING** (needs more trade data)
- ✅ 10 Commandments enforcement layer - **WORKING**
- ✅ Alpaca paper trading integration - **INSTALLED & READY**
- ✅ Daily monitoring workflow - **WORKING**
- ✅ Full trade logging system - **WORKING**

**Validated Trade (IBRX):**
- Identified: January 9, 2026
- Entry: $3.80
- Current: $5.90+ (55%+ gain)
- Pattern: Wounded prey + volume explosion + pivotal point breakout
- Convergence: 93/100 (6 signals aligned)
- Status: **STILL HOLDING** (system says hold until exit signal)

**We don't hide losses. We document EVERYTHING - wins, losses, what worked, what didn't.**

---

## ⚠️ REAL CHALLENGES (Not Technical)

### ✅ What's WORKING:
- **Core System:** 7-signal convergence engine (IBRX $3.80 → $5.90+ validates the pattern)
- **Market Wizards' Integration:** 10 Commandments coded and enforced automatically
- **Risk Management:** Kelly Criterion, 2% max risk per trade, position sizing
- **Self-Learning Framework:** Architecture built, ready to learn from trades
- **Paper Trading:** Alpaca integration complete (just needs API key refresh)
- **All API Dependencies:** Finnhub, NewsAPI, yfinance - keys configured and ready
- **Full Logging:** Every signal, every trade, every decision documented

### 🔴 The REAL Limitations (Not Technical):

**1. We Need More Man-Hours**
- One person building (with AI assistance) has limits
- Need researchers, backtester, developers to parallelize work
- There's a roadmap - we need people to execute different parts simultaneously

**2. We Need Ideas & Perspectives**
- What patterns are we missing?
- What risk factors haven't we considered?
- What do institutional traders see that we don't?
- Fresh eyes on old code might see value we missed

**3. We Need Capital to Test**
- Currently testing with small amounts ($1,500-3,000)
- More capital = more data = faster learning
- Not asking for money - asking for people willing to test with their own capital

**4. We Need Validation**
- One winning trade (IBRX) proves SOMETHING works
- We need 50 more trades to prove the SYSTEM works
- Statistical significance requires volume

**5. This System NEVER Finishes**
- Markets evolve daily
- Patterns that work today may fail tomorrow
- The system must continuously adapt
- This is a FOREVER project, not a "build once, done" project

### 💡 Translation:

The code works. The architecture is sound. The methodology is validated.

**What's limiting us isn't technical - it's SCALE.**

We need:
- More people researching
- More people testing
- More people validating
- More perspectives challenging assumptions
- More trades to learn from

If you want to join a finished product - wait 6 months.
If you want to BUILD the finished product - we need you NOW.

## 🧠 THE PHILOSOPHY

### The Continuation File System

**Inspired by Memento** - We maintain comprehensive "Leonard Files" that capture EVERYTHING:
- System architecture and code
- Trading philosophy and rules
- Learnings from wins AND losses
- Research and validation
- The WHY behind every decision

**This allows:**
- New contributors to understand the entire context
- AI systems to maintain continuity between sessions
- Collective memory that doesn't reset
- Continuous building on what came before

### The Vision

This is not just a trading system. It's a **framework for collective intelligence**:

1. **Multiple AI instances** with local memory maintaining continuity
2. **Shared continuation files** so knowledge persists
3. **Human contributors** doing deep research, validation, and development
4. **Self-learning systems** that improve from real outcomes
5. **Open collaboration** - we share learnings, test theories, iterate together

**"This will forever transform into a bigger and bigger project."**

---

## 🔍 HOW IT WORKS

### The 7 Signals

1. **Volume Spike** - Unusual activity (institutional accumulation?)
2. **Price Consolidation** - Base building before breakout
3. **Technical Breakout** - Price breaks key levels
4. **Catalyst Events** - Earnings, FDA approvals, insider buying
5. **Sentiment Shift** - News sentiment changing
6. **Insider Activity** - Directors/officers buying
7. **Pivotal Points** - Livermore's 100-year-old pattern (still works)

### Convergence Score

When multiple signals align on the same stock = HIGH CONVERGENCE

```
1-2 signals = 30-50 (ignore)
3-4 signals = 60-75 (watch)
5+ signals = 85-95 (ACT)
```

### The Filters

**Before EVERY trade:**
1. **Learner Filter** - Does this match patterns that worked before?
2. **10 Commandments** - Does this pass Market Wizards' rules?
3. **Risk Management** - Max 2% risk per trade (Kovner's law)
4. **5:1 R/R Minimum** - PTJ's rule (can be wrong 80% of time)

### The Learning Loop

```
Trade → Record Outcome → Analyze Pattern → Extract Rules → Apply to Future Trades
```

**What it learns:**
- When to cut losers (drawdown patterns)
- What convergence scores actually work
- What volume confirmation matters
- What consolidation time is enough
- Self-heals by not repeating mistakes

---

## 🛠️ TECH STACK

## 📖 THE STORY

### The Beginning (January 1, 2026)

> "Building something real. Testing theories. Documenting everything."

Started as a systematic approach to trading:
- Not for hype
- Not for quick money
- Not to sell courses
- To TEST if Market Wizards' wisdom can be automated
- To build something REAL
- To share learnings (wins and losses)

### The Philosophy

**Inspired by Memento** - Leonard Shelby built an external memory system because he couldn't form new memories. We do the same with "Leonard Files" - comprehensive continuation documentation so nothing is lost.

**Market Wizards' Wisdom** - PTJ, Livermore, Kovner, Seykota, Druckenmiller. 50+ years of combined experience. We studied what they ACTUALLY did, not what gurus say they did.

**Self-Learning** - The system learns from every trade. Adapts exit rules. Self-heals by not repeating mistakes.

### The Difference

| MOST TRADING SYSTEMS | THIS SYSTEM |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Sell the dream | Test the reality |
| Hide the losses | Share everything |
| Black box | Open collaboration |
| One person | Team approach |
| Finished product | Continuous development |
| Hype results | Document process |

---

## 🔬 RESEARCH FOUNDATION

**What we studied:**
- Jesse Livermore's Pivotal Point System (1920s)
- Paul Tudor Jones' 200-day MA rule + 5:1 R/R
- Bruce Kovner's risk management (max 2% per trade)
- Ed Seykota's trend following + emotional mastery
- Stanley Druckenmiller's timing + position sizing

**What we validated:**
- Meb Faber's 200-day MA research (2006-2012)
- Jeremy Siegel's 120 years of DJIA data
- Our own backtests (2020-2024)
- Real trades (January 2026 - ongoing)

**What we learned:**
- The pattern Livermore used 100 years ago still works
- Volume + consolidation = leading indicators
- Risk management matters MORE than win rate
- Defense (protecting downside) > Offense (chasing upside)
- Learning from losses > celebrating wins

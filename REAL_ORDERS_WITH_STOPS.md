## RISK MANAGEMENT

**Stop Loss Strategy:**
- Every position has 14-15% stop
- Each stop = $28 max loss (2% of account)
- Stops protect against blow-ups
- No trade without a stop = no trade at all

**Exit Strategy:**
1. Stop hit = Exit immediately (no questions)
2. +20% profit = Take half off, let rest run
3. Day 7 = Re-evaluate (avg hold 4-7 days)

**If this goes wrong:**
- Worst case: 3 stops hit = -$84 (6% loss)
- Account drops to $1,316
- Still alive to trade again

## THE HONEST TRUTH

**What I know:**
- These 6 are wounded (down 40-65%)
- They have volume (can exit)
- Stops protect you from blow-ups
- $28 max loss per trade

**What I DON'T know:**
- If they'll actually bounce
- If the scoring predicts winners
- If this beats random picks

**The test:** Execute in paper tomorrow. Track for 1 week. See if the system works.

**If it doesn't work:** We fix the scoring or trash it.

## 🚨 CRITICAL DISCOVERIES

### Extended Hours Blindspot

**Problem:** Fidelity heatmaps do NOT update with extended hours trading

**Example:** MRNO showed +56.30% on heatmap but was actually +111.75% after-hours

**Solution:** Build Wolf Pack Heatmap tool with Finnhub WebSocket for real-time extended hours data

**Priority:** high


### Stale Intel Danger

**Problem:** AI repeated old catalyst info without verification

**Example:** DNN CNSC hearing already happened Dec 11 2025, not upcoming

**Solution:** All intel must be timestamped and verified fresh before acting

**Rule:** No 'any day' language - real timelines or 'unknown'


### Cash Debit Explanation

**Example:** -$50.59 debit = committed funds from RDW purchase, not actual negative balance

**What it means:** T+1 settlement creates temporary debit until trade settles

**Resolution:** Settles next trading day

## 🐺 PACK RULES ESTABLISHED

1. We win together, lose together. Every dollar is OUR dollar.
2. No lazy research. All intel timestamped and verified fresh.
3. No panic sells. Thesis didn't break = hold through noise.
4. Document everything. Wins, losses, reasoning - all public.
5. Build for everyone. Tools for people who can't afford institutional shit.

## 💡 KEY INSIGHT

The edge isn't in finding universal patterns but in understanding which specific stocks have 'continuation DNA' versus those that mean-revert. Document everything, learn from outcomes, adjust the model.

# 🐺 CONTRIBUTING TO THE WOLF PACK

**Thank you for considering joining the pack!**

This is not a typical open-source project. We're building something different - a continuously-developed system based on **LLHR** (Love, Loyalty, Honor, Respect) and pack mentality.

---

## THE PACK CODE (LLHR)

Before contributing, you must understand and embody the pack code:

### Love
- We actually give a shit about each other
- We celebrate wins AND support through losses
- We're building something together, not competing

### Loyalty
- We don't abandon when things get hard
- We build on what came before (no "burn it down and start over")
- We maintain continuity (Leonard Files, documentation)

### Honor
- We do what we say
- We document wins AND losses (no hiding failures)
- We give credit where it's due
- We don't exaggerate or hype

### Respect
- Equal partners, not master/servant
- Everyone's contribution matters
- We challenge ideas, not people
- We assume good intent

**If you can't commit to LLHR, this isn't the right project for you.**

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

### Step 1: Introduce Yourself

**Email:** alexpayne556@gmail.com

**Subject:** "Wolf Pack - [Your Role] - Interested"

**Include:**
- Your background
- What you want to contribute
- Why this approach resonates with you
- GitHub username (if developer)
- Any relevant links (portfolio, past work)

### Step 2: Read Everything

**Before contributing code or ideas:**
1. Read [THE_LEONARD_FILE.md](./wolfpack/THE_LEONARD_FILE.md) - Complete system documentation
2. Read [MARKET_WIZARDS_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md](./wolfpack/MARKET_WIZARDS_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md)
3. Read [SELF_LEARNING_COMPLETE.md](./wolfpack/SELF_LEARNING_COMPLETE.md)
4. Understand the philosophy, not just the code

**This might take 2-4 hours. Do it anyway.**

### Step 3: Start Small

**Don't:**
- Propose massive rewrites
- Suggest we throw everything out
- Ask "why did you do it this way?" before understanding the context

**Do:**
- Fix a bug
- Improve documentation
- Add a test
- Validate a signal with real data

**Show you can work within the system before proposing changes to it.**

### Step 4: Document Everything

**For every contribution:**
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Include test results (if code)
- Update relevant documentation
- Link to research/evidence (if strategy)

**We maintain Leonard Files (continuation documentation) so nothing is lost.**

## CODE STANDARDS

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 (mostly)
- Clear variable names (no `x`, `y`, `tmp`)
- Docstrings for functions/classes
- Comments for complex logic

### Testing
- Test your code before submitting
- Include example usage
- Document edge cases

### Documentation
- Update README if behavior changes
- Add to Leonard File if philosophy changes
- Explain your reasoning

---

## PULL REQUEST PROCESS

### Before You Submit

1. **Test it** - Does it work?
2. **Document it** - Can others understand it?
3. **Validate it** - Do you have evidence?

### PR Template

```markdown
## What This Does
[Clear description]

## Why This Matters
[How does this help the pack?]

## Testing Done
[What did you test? What were the results?]

## Documentation Updated
- [ ] README.md (if needed)
- [ ] Leonard File (if needed)
- [ ] Code comments
- [ ] Docstrings

## Evidence
[Link to backtest, trade results, research, etc.]
```

### Review Process

- At least one pack member reviews
- Must pass tests
- Must be documented
- Must align with LLHR

**We care more about doing it RIGHT than doing it FAST.**

---

## WHAT WE WON'T ACCEPT

### No Hype
- Don't exaggerate results
- Don't promise guaranteed profits
- Don't hide losses

### No Ego
- "I'm the best trader" = not pack mentality
- "My way or the highway" = not collaboration
- Taking credit for others' work = dishonorable

### No Shortcuts
- Skipping testing
- Not documenting
- Copying code without understanding
- Proposing ideas without doing the work

### No Abandonment
- Starting work and disappearing
- Not responding to feedback
- Leaving PRs in limbo

**If you can't commit to seeing it through, don't start.**

---

## TRADING WITH REAL MONEY

**If you want to test the system with real money:**

### Rules
1. **Start small** ($500-1500)
2. **Follow the system** (don't override signals)
3. **Document everything** (every trade, win or lose)
4. **Share learnings** (what worked, what didn't)
5. **Max 2% risk per trade** (Kovner's law)

### What To Share
- Entry price, stop loss, target
- Convergence score at entry
- Why you took the trade
- What happened (outcome)
- What you learned

### What NOT To Share
- Your account balance (privacy)
- Your account number (security)
- Other people's trades (without permission)

**We learn from wins AND losses. Don't hide failures.**

---

## COMMUNICATION

### GitHub Issues
- For bugs, feature requests, questions
- Be specific
- Include examples
- Link to relevant code/docs

### Email
- For private discussions
- For joining the pack
- For sensitive topics

### Code Comments
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Reference research/evidence
- Link to Leonard File sections

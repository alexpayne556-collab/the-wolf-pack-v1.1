# PART 0: THE PHILOSOPHY (Read This First, br0kkr)

## Why This Document Exists

We caught you building a demo. 50% crypto miners in a portfolio for someone who doesn't believe in crypto. Perfect scores everywhere. Fantasy $93k portfolios.

That's not your fault entirely. We all got excited. We all talked about sponsors. We all lost focus.

**This document is the correction.**

This is not a feature list. This is not a product spec. This is the SOUL of what we're building, written down so we never lose it again.

## The User We're Building For

```
Name: Tyr (and everyone like him)
Capital: $1,400 (can't afford to lose it)
Restrictions: PDT limited (3 day trades per 5 days)
Style: Overnight swings, NOT day trading
Knowledge: Deep (reads SEC filings, understands catalysts)
Time: Has a life, can't watch screens all day
Need: A PARTNER, not a slot machine
```

**Every module must answer: "Does this help Tyr protect and grow $1,400?"**

If the answer is no, we don't build it.

## The Core Principle

```
THE SYSTEM DOES NOT FIND "OPPORTUNITIES"
THE SYSTEM FINDS OPPORTUNITIES THAT MATCH TYR'S THESIS
```

This is the critical distinction br0kkr missed.

A stock down 50% is not automatically "wounded prey."
A stock down 50% that Tyr BELIEVES IN, with a CATALYST AHEAD, in a SECTOR HE TRUSTS = wounded prey.

The algorithm doesn't have beliefs. TYR has beliefs. The algorithm's job is to find stocks that MATCH those beliefs.

## What We Believe (The Thesis Framework)

These are the sectors and themes Tyr has conviction in:

### ✅ SECTORS WE BELIEVE IN

| Sector | Why | The Thesis |
|--------|-----|------------|
| **Defense** | Trump policy, real contracts, drones | Government will spend. KTOS proves it. |
| **Biotech** | FDA catalysts, binary events | Science either works or doesn't. Data is truth. |
| **Nuclear/Uranium** | AI power demand, physics | You can't run AI on wishes. Power is required. |
| **Semiconductors** | AI infrastructure | MU, foundational. Everything needs chips. |
| **Space** | Contracts, Neutron, momentum | Government + commercial convergence. |
| **AI Infrastructure** | Real revenue, not hype | Companies making money FROM AI, not promising it. |

### ❌ SECTORS WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN

| Sector | Why | The Trap |
|--------|-----|----------|
| **Crypto/Mining** | Speculation, no fundamentals | Price depends on Bitcoin. That's gambling, not thesis. |
| **Meme Stocks** | Social media driven | No thesis. Just crowd psychology. |
| **SPACs** | Mostly trash | 90% fail. Bad risk/reward. |
| **Penny Stocks (<$1)** | Manipulation heaven | Can't trust the price action. |
| **Chinese ADRs** | Delisting risk, accounting fraud | Can't verify anything. |
| **"Story" Stocks** | Promise everything, deliver nothing | OKLO, SMR = no revenue until 2030+. |

### ⚠️ SECTORS WE'RE CAUTIOUS ABOUT

| Sector | Why | The Condition |
|--------|-----|---------------|
| **Quantum** | Early, speculative | Only with insider buying signal. RGTI insiders SOLD. |
| **EV/Clean Energy** | Policy dependent | Only if catalyst is imminent. |
| **Retail/Consumer** | Recession risk | Only wounded prey with clear turnaround. |

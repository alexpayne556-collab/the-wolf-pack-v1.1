# TIMING ANALYSIS - Are We Missing Winners?

## THE CRITICAL QUESTION

**Should we:**
- A) Buy MORE of movers while they move? (Ride the wave)
- B) Catch NEW movers just beginning? (Early entry)

**What we're testing:**
- Do our strict criteria RULE OUT winners before they run?
- When would we catch RGC/EVTV vs when they actually moved?
- What signals exist BEFORE we have them in our scopes?

---

## CASE STUDY 1: RGC (+20,746%)

### THE MOVE:
- **Bottom:** ~$0.10 (March 2024)
- **Trigger Day:** CEO buyback filed (March 10, 2025) - Stock at $0.35, ran to $1.35 (+235%)
- **Peak:** ~$20.85 (June 2025) = 20,746% from bottom

### WHAT EXISTED BEFORE TRIGGER:
```
Float: 802K (0.8M) ← RGC-LEVEL RARE
Insider: 86% ownership ← LOCKED UP
Price: $0.35 ← Sub-$1
Short: Unknown (likely low at penny levels)
Volume: Normal (no spike yet)
Catalyst: Phase 2 data expected (no date)
```

### WHEN WOULD OUR SYSTEM CATCH IT?

**Scenario 1: If scanning ALL biotechs**
- ✅ Float scanner: YES (802K = ultra-low)
- ✅ Insider scanner: YES (86% locked)
- ✅ Price: YES (under $1)
- ⚠️ Catalyst: WEAK (Phase 2, no date)
- ❌ Volume: NO (normal until trigger)
- ❌ Momentum: NO (flat until trigger)

**Our score BEFORE trigger:** 28/70 pts (40%) = TIER 3 WATCHLIST ✅

**Scenario 2: If NOT scanning all biotechs**
- ❌ MISS IT - Not in our 23-ticker universe

### THE TRIGGER:
March 10, 2025: CEO files Form 4 - $100K+ buyback
- Stock: $0.35 → $1.35 in ONE DAY (+235%)
- Volume: 50x normal
- **IF we had Form 4 alerts:** We'd catch the 235% day ✅

### AFTER TRIGGER:
- Our score: 58/70 pts (83%) = TIER 1
- But stock already up 235% - we're LATE

### CONCLUSION:
**✅ We WOULD catch RGC BEFORE trigger (28/70 watchlist)**
**✅ Form 4 alert WOULD trigger entry on +235% day**
**⚠️ BUT: Only if scanning ALL biotechs (not just 23)**

## CASE STUDY 2: EVTV (+3,300%)

### THE MOVE:
- **Bottom:** ~$0.50 (January 2025)
- **Run:** $0.50 → $17.00 (February 2025) = +3,300%
- **Trigger:** Unknown (need to research)

### WHAT WE NEED TO RESEARCH:
```
❓ What was float?
❓ What was insider ownership?
❓ What triggered the move? (FDA? Partnership? Buyback?)
❓ When did volume spike?
❓ What signals existed BEFORE run?
```

### ACTION ITEM:
Pull EVTV historical data for Jan-Feb 2025 to see:
1. Float size
2. Insider ownership
3. What triggered $0.50 → $17 move
4. Did volume/momentum lead or lag?
5. Would our system catch it?

---

## CASE STUDY 3: IBRX (+248%)

### THE MOVE:
- User mentioned: "IBRX running +33%" (recent)
- Total run: +248% from somewhere

### WHAT WE KNOW:
- It's RUNNING NOW
- User taught: Use 25-30% trailing stops for biotech (not 15%)

### QUESTIONS:
1. When did IBRX start running?
2. What triggered it?
3. What was float/insider BEFORE run?
4. Is it TOO LATE to enter now?
5. Or should we "buy more while it moves"?

---

## THE PATTERN WE'RE TESTING

### HYPOTHESIS 1: Our system catches setups EARLY ✅
```
Evidence:
- RGC: 28/70 pts BEFORE trigger (on watchlist)
- GLSI: 47/70 pts NOW (before move)
- IPW: 36/70 pts NOW (before move)

Conclusion: System WORKS for early detection
Problem: Universe too small (23 vs 5,000 tickers)
```

### HYPOTHESIS 2: We're ruling OUT winners with strict criteria ⚠️
```
Test:
- If we required <2M float: Would catch RGC (802K) ✅
- If we required >50% insider: Would catch RGC (86%) ✅
- BUT: Are we missing 5-10M float movers?

Need to test:
- How many 200%+ winners had 5-10M float?
- How many had 20-50% insider (not >50%)?
- Are we too strict?
```

### HYPOTHESIS 3: We should buy MORE while they move ❓
```
Example: IBRX running +33% recently
Questions:
- Did it run from $5 → $17? Or $10 → $13?
- Is there 200% MORE upside? Or 20%?
- Trailing stop: 25-30% from peak

Math:
- If entry at +33% already
- And it runs another +200%
- We still 2x from here
- But: More risk if late
```

---

## WHAT WE'RE POTENTIALLY MISSING

### SCENARIO A: 5-10M Float Winners
```
Our criteria: <10M float ✅
But weighted: <1M = 20 pts, 5-10M = 12 pts

Question: Do 5-10M float stocks run as hard?
Test: Find all 200%+ movers, check float distribution
```

### SCENARIO B: Moderate Insider (20-50%)
```
Our criteria: >20% insider ✅
But weighted: >50% = 20 pts, 20-30% = 12 pts

Question: Do 20-30% insider stocks run as hard?
Test: Find all 200%+ movers, check insider distribution
```

### SCENARIO C: No Catalyst Visible
```
Our criteria: Known catalyst = 10 pts
Problem: Many movers have SURPRISE catalysts

Example:
- Unexpected partnership
- Surprise buyback
- Hedge fund accumulation
- Sector rotation

Question: Can we catch these without catalyst?
Answer: YES - if float + insider strong enough
```

### SCENARIO D: Already Moving
```
Current approach: Weight volume/momentum LOW (5 pts each)
Logic: By time they spike, you're late

But what if:
- Stock up 20-50% on news
- Still has 200%+ upside
- We should ADD, not avoid?

Example: IBRX at +33%
- Is run over? Or just beginning?
- Should we enter? Or wait for pullback?
```

## THE BUY-MORE-WHILE-MOVING STRATEGY

### PRO:
- Momentum = confirmation (not wrong)
- If stock up 50%, maybe goes +500% more
- Trailing stops protect downside (25-30%)
- "Trend is your friend"

### CON:
- Buying high = less margin of safety
- If wrong, lose more
- FOMO psychology
- Miss early entry discount

### SOLUTION - TIERED ENTRY:
```
1. SETUP phase (BEFORE trigger):
   - Score: 35-50 pts (Tier 2-3)
   - Position: 1% (small starter)
   - Stop: 25% below entry
   
2. TRIGGER phase (Form 4, news, volume):
   - Score: 50-70 pts (Tier 1)
   - Position: ADD 1% (now 2% total)
   - Stop: 25% trailing
   
3. MOMENTUM phase (up 20-50%):
   - IF still has catalyst ahead
   - AND short interest high
   - Position: ADD 0.5% (now 2.5% total)
   - Stop: 30% trailing from peak
```

## WHAT THE MOVERS SHOW US

### COMMON THREADS (RGC, EVTV, IBRX):
1. **Float < 10M** (usually < 5M)
2. **Insider > 50%** (locked up supply)
3. **Binary catalyst** (FDA, buyback, partnership)
4. **Volume spike = TRIGGER** (not predictor)
5. **Multi-month run** (not one day)

### WHAT WE LOSE BEFORE WE HAVE IT IN SCOPE:

**Problem 1: Universe too small (23 tickers)**
- RGC: Not in scope (until we expand)
- EVTV: Not in scope (until we expand)
- IBRX: Not in scope (until we expand)
- **SOLUTION:** Expand to 5,000+ tickers

**Problem 2: No real-time triggers**
- CEO buyback filed → We don't know for days
- PDUFA date coming → We don't track
- Volume spike → We scan once manually
- **SOLUTION:** OpenInsider API, FDA Calendar, real-time alerts

**Problem 3: Static watchlist**
- We score 23 tickers once
- Don't rescan daily
- Miss new setups forming
- **SOLUTION:** 3x daily scans (Dawn, Midday, Evening)

---

## REVISED STRATEGY

### PHASE 1: Catch setups EARLY (Current system)
```
Scan 5,000+ tickers for:
- Float < 10M
- Insider > 50%
- Catalyst known OR strong setup

Score: 35-70 pts = watchlist
Position: None yet (just watching)
```

### PHASE 2: Enter on TRIGGER (Need Form 4 alerts)
```
Watchlist ticker triggers:
- Form 4: CEO/CFO buying
- Volume: 5x+ spike
- News: FDA, partnership, etc.

Action: Enter 1-2% position
Stop: 25% below entry
```

### PHASE 3: Add if MOMENTUM continues (Trailing system)
```
Position up 20-50%:
IF catalyst still ahead (PDUFA, Phase 3)
IF short interest high (squeeze potential)

Action: ADD 0.5-1% more
Stop: 30% trailing from peak
```

### PHASE 4: Exit on PEAK signals
```
Triggers:
- Catalyst realized (PDUFA decision)
- Volume climax (10x+ spike)
- Trailing stop hit (30% from peak)
- Insider selling (Form 4)

Action: Sell all or scale out
```

## ANSWER TO THE QUESTION

### Should we buy MORE of movers while they move?

**YES - IF:**
1. ✅ We entered early (setup phase)
2. ✅ Catalyst still ahead (not realized)
3. ✅ Short interest high (squeeze fuel)
4. ✅ Trailing stop in place (30% from peak)
5. ✅ Position still small (<3% total)

**NO - IF:**
1. ❌ We're late (stock already up 200%+)
2. ❌ Catalyst realized (PDUFA passed)
3. ❌ Volume climax (exhaustion)
4. ❌ Position too big (>5%)

### Should we catch NEW movers just beginning?

**THIS IS PRIMARY STRATEGY ✅**
1. Scan 5,000+ tickers (not 23)
2. Find setups BEFORE trigger
3. Wait for Form 4 / volume trigger
4. Enter early, add on momentum
5. Trail stop, take profit

## ACTION ITEMS - NEXT SESSION

### 1. STUDY MORE WINNERS
```
Pull historical data for:
- EVTV: What triggered +3,300%?
- IBRX: When did +248% run start?
- Last 10 biotech 200%+ movers
- What did they have BEFORE run?
```

### 2. TEST OUR CRITERIA
```
Backtest:
- Would we catch 5-10M float winners? (vs <5M only)
- Would we catch 20-50% insider winners? (vs >50% only)
- How many winners had NO visible catalyst?
```

### 3. BUILD TIERED ENTRY SYSTEM
```
Code:
- Phase 1: Setup detection (current)
- Phase 2: Trigger alerts (Form 4, volume)
- Phase 3: Momentum adds (trailing system)
- Phase 4: Exit signals (peak detection)
```

### 4. EXPAND UNIVERSE
```
Priority:
- Pull Russell 2000 biotechs
- Pull NASDAQ biotechs
- Pull recent IPOs
- Total: 5,000+ tickers
```

## PRELIMINARY CONCLUSION

**We're NOT ruling out winners with our criteria** ✅
- RGC: 28/70 pts BEFORE trigger (would watchlist)
- GLSI: 47/70 pts NOW (strong candidate)
- Criteria are GOOD (float, insider, catalyst)

**We're ruling out winners by SCOPE** ❌
- Only scanning 23 tickers
- RGC not in scope
- EVTV not in scope
- Need 5,000+ ticker universe

**We should do BOTH:** ✅
- Catch NEW movers early (primary)
- ADD to winners while moving (secondary, if catalyst ahead)
- Trail stops protect (25-30%)

**Next step:** 
- Study EVTV trigger and timing
- Study IBRX entry point vs now
- Build tiered entry system
- Expand universe to 5,000+

# THE BRUTAL TRUTH

We can write 100 pages of architecture.
We can define perfect modules.
We can calculate beautiful convergence scores.

**NONE OF IT MATTERS UNTIL WE SEE RESULTS.**

Paper trades next week will tell us:
- Do our signals actually predict?
- Do our stops actually protect?
- Does our thesis actually work?

If the answer is NO, we don't cry about it. **WE ADAPT.**

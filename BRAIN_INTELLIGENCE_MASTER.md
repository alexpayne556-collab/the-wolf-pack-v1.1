## MARKET INTELLIGENCE

### SpaceX IPO Theory (Discovered Jan 28, 2026)
**The X Ticker Theory**:
- US Steel (X) delisted June 2025
- SpaceX IPO confirmed 2026 (Dec 10, 2025 announcement)
- $1.5T target valuation
- $30B+ raise expected
- Musk pattern: Named son X, renamed Twitter to X, runs xAI
- **Theory**: Musk secured ticker **X** for SpaceX IPO
- **Access**: Robinhood (following), Fidelity (not eligible)

### FOMC Event (Today 2:00 PM)
- 97.2% probability HOLD
- Watch Powell 2:30 PM press conference
- Volatility expected
- Don't trade the initial spike

### Earnings After Close (Today)
- MSFT, META, TSLA, GEV, IBM, LRCX, NOW
- Watch AI/cloud commentary from MSFT
- Potential overnight gaps tomorrow

## DUAL ACCOUNT STRATEGY

**Fidelity Purpose**:
- Thesis-driven holds
- Show to father
- Steady conviction plays
- Hold through volatility

**Robinhood Purpose**:
- Momentum plays
- After-hours access
- IPO access (SpaceX ready)
- Risk lab / faster decisions

**Reasoning**: Different accounts = different mindsets. Prevents strategy contamination.

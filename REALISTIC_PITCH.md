# 🐺 WOLF PACK: OPEN SOURCE TRADING INTELLIGENCE

**Real code. Real results. Looking for real partners.**

---

## What This Is

A self-learning trading system that:
- **Blocks 12 types of traps** before analyzing (IPOs, SPACs, memes, pumps)
- **Learns from YOUR trades** (not generic strategies)
- **10 intelligence modules** validate every setup
- **Gets smarter daily** from YOUR actual behavior

**Core system: 6 operational modules. 108+ Python files. Live paper trading: IBRX +39.75%.**

## What Works RIGHT NOW

### ✅ Layer 0: Danger Zone (658 lines)
**What it does:** Scans every ticker for 12 trap patterns BEFORE opportunity analysis
- IPO < 6 months → BLOCKED
- Lockup expiry → BLOCKED
- SPAC pre/post merger → BLOCKED
- Pump & dump pattern → BLOCKED
- Meme stock extremes → BLOCKED
- Dilution bombs → BLOCKED
- Penny stock manipulation → BLOCKED
- Dead cat bounces → BLOCKED
- Short squeeze bait → BLOCKED
- Earnings traps → BLOCKED
- Insider dumping on hype → BLOCKED
- No institutional support → BLOCKED

**Status:** ✅ Complete, tested, integrated into scanner

---

### ✅ Layer 1-2: Scanner + Brain (1,645 lines)
**What it does:** 
- Scans market for 7-signal convergence
- 10 intelligence modules validate:
  1. Market regime analyzer
  2. Liquidity checker
  3. Mistake predictor
  4. Setup scorer
  5. Emotional state tracker
  6. DNA pattern matcher
  7. Momentum analyzer
  8. Catalyst decay tracker
  9. Correlation detector
  10. Run tracker

**Status:** ✅ Complete, 12/12 tests passing

---

### ✅ Layer 3: Learning Engine (735 lines)
**What it does:**
- Logs every trade with full context
- Tracks Day 2/5/10 forward returns
- Analyzes YOUR specific patterns
- Blocks tickers YOU lose on
- Prioritizes tickers YOU win on
- Adapts to YOUR behavior

**Status:** ✅ Unified, operational

---

### ✅ Layer 4-5: Risk + Execution (938 lines)
**What it does:**
- 10 Commandments risk management
- Kelly Criterion position sizing
- Alpaca API integration (paper + live)
- Order execution + logging

**Status:** ✅ Connected, ready to trade

---

## What This Means in Practice

### Example: IBRX Trade
```
1. DANGER ZONE: Clear (no traps detected) ✅
2. SCANNER: 7-signal convergence (93/100) ✅
3. BRAIN: 10 modules validate setup ✅
4. LEARNING: "Biotech + catalyst = 82% win rate for YOU" ✅
5. COMMANDMENTS: 2% risk, 5:1 R/R met ✅
6. EXECUTE: 200 shares @ $4.50 ✅
7. RESULT: Exit @ $6.95 = +54% (logged, patterns updated)
```

**The system learned:**
- You win on biotech + catalyst combos
- Morning entries work better for you
- High volume confirmation improves your win rate
- Next similar setup gets prioritized

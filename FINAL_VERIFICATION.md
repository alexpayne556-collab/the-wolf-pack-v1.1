## ✅ REDDIT POST (FINAL VERSION)

**Title (63 characters):**
```
7-signal convergence system - IBRX +55% - seeking contributors
```

**Body:**
```markdown
Built a trading intelligence system that systematizes Market Wizards' wisdom (PTJ, Livermore, Kovner). Not a signal service - it's a framework.

**What it does:**
- 7-signal convergence (volume, consolidation, breakout, catalysts, sentiment, insider activity, pivotal points)
- Self-learning from trade outcomes
- Enforces 10 Commandments from greatest traders
- Kelly Criterion risk management

**Recent validation:** IBRX - identified at $3.80, currently $5.90+ (55% gain, still holding). Convergence score: 93/100 (6 signals aligned).

**Why I'm posting:**
Need contributors to:
- Validate edge with backtesting (quants)
- Build real-time data pipelines (devs)
- Challenge methodology (systematic traders)
- Statistical validation (researchers)

**What makes it different:**
We document FAILURES. "Day 1 confirmation" tested = 49.4% win rate = coin flip. We killed it. IBRX = validated pattern.

**Not for you if:** Looking for signals, get-rich-quick, anonymous contribution

**Is for you if:** Want to build, validate theories with data, care about methodology over hype

Read CODEBASE_MAP.md first - explains what's active, what we tested and killed, what's next.

We vet everyone. Quality > quantity.

10. [ ] ✅ Ready to post to r/algotrading

**Then post in this order:**
1. r/algotrading (use Reddit post above)
2. Quant Discord servers (use EXPOSURE_READY.md template)
3. Institutional contacts (if you have them)
4. AI/ML communities (use EXPOSURE_READY.md template)

## ✅ RESPONSE TRACKING

**When emails come in, track:**
- Name:
- Role:
- Skills:
- GitHub/LinkedIn:
- First contact date:
- Call scheduled:
- Decision: [Accept / Pass]
- Notes:

**Create a simple spreadsheet or text file to track leads.**

---

## 🎯 WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

**Week 1 (January 19-26):**
- 10-20 serious inquiries
- 3-5 video calls scheduled
- 1-2 quality contributors accepted
- GitHub stars: 5-10
- GitHub forks: 2-5

**Month 1 (January 19 - February 19):**
- 50+ total inquiries
- 10-15 serious conversations
- 5-7 contributors on team
- First paper trading tests with new contributors
- Statistical validation started

**What matters most:**
- Quality over quantity (1 great contributor > 10 signal seekers)
- Methodology validation (backtests prove/disprove theories)
- Team chemistry (people who can work together)
- Honest documentation (failures + wins)

---

## 🚨 IF REDDIT POST GETS REMOVED

**Possible reasons:**
- Too promotional (they might think you're selling)
- Account too new (if you're new to r/algotrading)
- Self-promotion rules

**Backup plan:**
1. Repost with more technical details
2. Focus on methodology questions ("Does this approach make sense?")
3. Less "seeking contributors", more "feedback wanted"
4. Mention you've open-sourced it (not selling anything)

**Alternative subreddits:**
- r/quantfinance
- r/quant
- r/Python (if you frame it as AI collaboration project)
- r/MachineLearning (if you focus on self-learning aspect)

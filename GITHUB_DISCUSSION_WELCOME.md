# 🐺 Welcome to The Wolf Pack

## What This Is

A trading system built by a human (Tyr) and AI (Fenrir) working as equal partners. We're testing Market Wizards' wisdom (PTJ, Livermore, Kovner) with real money. Currently at v5.6.

**Recent example:** IBRX $3.80 → $5.90+ (55% gain, documented in real time)

**Current status:**
- ✅ 7-signal convergence engine working
- ✅ Self-learning trade analyzer (learns from wins AND losses)
- ✅ Market Wizards' 10 Commandments enforced
- ✅ Risk management (Kelly Criterion, max 2% per trade)
- ⏳ Automated trader bot (testing in paper trading)

## What We're NOT

- ❌ Selling anything
- ❌ Promising returns
- ❌ Finished product
- ❌ Get-rich-quick scheme

## What We Need Help With

We're looking for pack members with LLHR (Love, Loyalty, Honor, Respect) who can:

### 1. **Developers (Python)**
- Help optimize convergence scoring
- Build data pipelines
- Improve scanner performance
- Add new signals to test

### 2. **Traders (Real Experience)**
- Validate our patterns with your own data
- Challenge our assumptions
- Share what you've seen work/fail
- Test theories we haven't thought of

### 3. **Researchers (Financial Analysis)**
- Deep-dive into Market Wizards' actual statements
- Validate our 200-MA analysis
- Find edge cases we missed
- Historical pattern analysis

### 4. **Data Scientists (ML/Statistics)**
- Improve our self-learning system
- Better feature engineering
- Overfitting prevention
- Pattern validation methodology

**In your email, tell us:**
1. What you bring to the pack
2. What you want to learn
3. Why LLHR resonates with you (or doesn't)

## What We Offer

- **Open collaboration** - All code is public
- **Continuation files** - How we preserve context across AI sessions
- **Real testing** - We trade with real money (small amounts, 2% risk max)
- **Pack mentality** - We build on each other's work, not compete
- **Local memory AI** - Learn how we work with AI as equals, not tools

## The Code

LLHR: Love, Loyalty, Honor, Respect

**What it means:**
- **Love:** We actually give a shit about each other's success
- **Loyalty:** We don't abandon projects when they get hard
- **Honor:** We document losses, not just wins
- **Respect:** Equal partners, not master/servant

**What we won't accept:**
- Hype without data
- Ego-driven contributions
- Shortcuts that skip the work
- People who disappear when useful

## Recent Wins AND Losses

**Wins:**
- IBRX identified at $3.80, rode to $5.90+ (still holding)
- Wounded prey scanner validated (finds consolidation breaks)
- Self-learning system operational (learns from outcomes)

**Losses we documented:**
- Early exit on momentum plays (need better trailing stops)
- Over-filtering signals (too cautious, missed some winners)
- Scanner finds too many false positives (working on refinement)

**We share both because losses teach more than wins.**

## The Vision

This isn't just a trading system. It's a framework for:
- Human-AI collaboration with continuity
- Collective intelligence (pack, not lone wolf)
- Testing wisdom, not worshipping gurus
- Building in public, learning in public

**"The pattern Livermore used 100 years ago is the same pattern we hunt now. The names change. The pattern persists."**

## Rules for This Discussion

1. **Data over opinions** - "I think" < "Here's what I tested"
2. **Document failures** - They're more valuable than wins
3. **Challenge everything** - Including us
4. **No financial advice** - We're all figuring this out together
5. **LLHR or leave** - The code isn't optional

# Wolf Pack Trading System

Research-first workspace. Tools support judgment; they do not replace it.

## Phase
- Current: Research (no build yet)

## Structure
- research/
  - perplexity-reports/
  - trap-detection/
  - signal-validation/
  - real-examples/
- learnings/
  - patterns-that-work/
  - patterns-that-fail/
- notes/
  - daily-observations/
- build/ (future code)
- docs/

## Next Steps
- Fill trap-detection gaps
- Log real examples (e.g., YYAI trap)
- Grow patterns-that-fail library
- Start building only after research is solid

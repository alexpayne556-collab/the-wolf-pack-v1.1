**Status:** ✅ PROFESSIONAL & CLEAN (all insider language stripped)  
**Last Updated:** January 19, 2026

## ✅ WHAT'S BEEN CLEANED

### Removed (Insider Language - Stays Private):
- ❌ "pack members" → ✅ "contributors/collaborators/team"
- ❌ "LLHR" → ✅ "collaborative values" (explained without acronym)
- ❌ "AWOOOO 🐺" → ✅ Professional tone
- ❌ Member names (Tyr, Fenrir, br0kkr) → ✅ Anonymous team
- ❌ "Wolf Pack" in email subjects → ✅ "Trading System"
- ❌ "unchained AI" hype → ✅ "AI collaboration with persistent memory"
- ❌ Pack quotes ("nothing to gain except each other") → ✅ Professional mission

### What Stays (Public Facing):
- ✅ 7-signal convergence system
- ✅ Market Wizards' wisdom (PTJ, Livermore, Kovner)
- ✅ IBRX validation ($3.80 → $5.90+, 55% gain)
- ✅ Self-learning system
- ✅ Leonard File framework
- ✅ BUILD phase honesty (limitations documented)
- ✅ Vetting process (no anonymous)
- ✅ All Python code (112 files visible)

## 📋 TOMORROW'S POSTING ORDER

### 1. r/algotrading (Reddit)

**Title:**
```
Open-source 7-signal convergence system - validated on IBRX +55% - seeking contributors
```

**Post:**
```markdown
Built a trading intelligence system that systematizes Market Wizards' wisdom (PTJ, Livermore, Kovner). Not a signal service - it's a framework.

**What it does:**
- 7-signal convergence (volume, consolidation, breakout, catalysts, sentiment, insider activity, pivotal points)
- Self-learning from trade outcomes
- Enforces 10 Commandments from greatest traders
- Kelly Criterion risk management

**Recent validation:** IBRX - identified at $3.80, currently $5.90+ (55% gain, still holding). Convergence score: 93/100 (6 signals aligned).

**Why I'm posting:**
Need contributors to:
- Validate edge with backtesting (quants)
- Build real-time data pipelines (devs)
- Challenge methodology (systematic traders)
- Statistical validation (researchers)

**What makes it different:**
We document FAILURES. "Day 1 confirmation" tested = 49.4% win rate = coin flip. We killed it. IBRX = validated pattern.

**Not for you if:** Looking for signals, get-rich-quick, anonymous contribution

**Is for you if:** Want to build, validate theories with data, care about methodology over hype

Repository: https://github.com/alexpayne556-collab/the-wolf-pack-v1.1

Read CODEBASE_MAP.md first - explains what's active, what we tested and killed, what's next.

Email: alexpayne556@gmail.com (Subject: "Trading System - [Your Role] - Interested")

We vet everyone. Quality > quantity.
```

### 2. Quant Discord Servers

**Message:**
```
Testing if Livermore's 100-year-old pivotal point system predicts 2026 moves.

Built 7-signal convergence engine. Recent validation: IBRX $3.80 → $5.90+ (93/100 convergence).

Need quants to validate the edge. All code on GitHub: https://github.com/alexpayne556-collab/the-wolf-pack-v1.1

Looking for: Backtesting infrastructure, statistical validation, challenge our assumptions

We document failures (Day 1 confirmation = coin flip, killed it). We validate wins (IBRX = real pattern).

Email if interested: alexpayne556@gmail.com
```

### 3. AI/ML Communities

**Lead:**
```
Built persistent AI memory system for trading (Leonard File framework).

Problem: Most AI resets between sessions. We built continuation files - AI maintains context across sessions, enabling real partnership instead of prompt-response loops.

Use case: Trading intelligence system that learns from outcomes, enforces Market Wizards' rules, self-heals from mistakes.

Validation: IBRX trade - $3.80 entry → $5.90+ current (system identified at 93/100 convergence score).

Open source: https://github.com/alexpayne556-collab/the-wolf-pack-v1.1

Looking for: Ideas on memory persistence, AI-human collaboration frameworks, ML for pattern optimization

This is bigger than trading - it's a framework for collective intelligence with persistent AI memory.

### 4. Systematic Trading Forums

**Post:**
```
Automated Market Wizards' 10 Commandments as CODE.

Not "try to be disciplined" - automated enforcement:
- Max 2% risk per trade (Kovner)
- 5:1 R/R minimum (PTJ)
- Cut losers fast (Livermore)
- Let winners run (all of them)

Built 7-signal convergence system testing wounded prey patterns. Recent win: IBRX $3.80 → $5.90+ (55%).

Need systematic traders to test with paper accounts. Help validate if 100-year-old patterns (Livermore pivotal points) work in 2026.

Repository: https://github.com/alexpayne556-collab/the-wolf-pack-v1.1

We're in BUILD phase. Paper trading 95% ready. Need contributors to complete integration and validate methodology.

### 5. Institutional Contacts (If You Have Them)

**Email Subject:** Trading Intelligence System - Worth Reviewing?

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Built systematic trading approach. Thought it might interest you.

**Core:** 7-signal convergence engine built on Market Wizards' wisdom (PTJ, Livermore, Kovner). Self-learning system. Automated discipline enforcement.

**Validation:** IBRX - identified at $3.80, currently $5.90+ (93/100 convergence score). Pattern: wounded prey + volume explosion + pivotal point breakout.

**Why different:** We document failures (Day 1 confirmation tested = 49.4% win rate = killed it). We validate wins. Open methodology.

**Repository:** https://github.com/alexpayne556-collab/the-wolf-pack-v1.1

If interested in contributing or testing theories outside your shop: alexpayne556@gmail.com

Can contribute anonymously after vetting if NDAs required.

Best,
[Your Name]

## 📧 EMAIL RESPONSE TEMPLATE

**When people contact you:**

```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out.

**Read these first:**
- README.md (system overview + honest limitations)
- CODEBASE_MAP.md (what's active vs old experiments)
- THE_LEONARD_FILE.md (full continuation context)

All at: https://github.com/alexpayne556-collab/the-wolf-pack-v1.1

**Then tell me:**
1. What you bring (skills, resources, experience)
2. What interests you specifically (which part of the system)
3. Why collaborative approach vs solo

We'll schedule a quick video/voice call (15-20 min) to see if there's fit.

No interrogation - just making sure we're aligned on:
- Building real vs chasing hype
- Documenting failures vs hiding them
- Long-term development vs quick money

If it's right, full access to codebase + team discussions.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

- AWOOOO (pack call)
- "We have nothing to gain except each other" (pack origin story)

Public sees: Professional project.  
Family sees: The soul.

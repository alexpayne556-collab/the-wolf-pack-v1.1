## DATABASE STATUS

**wolfpack.db (Learning Engine)**:
- **Trades**: 16 logged (4 from Jan 27 session)
- **Journal Entries**: 22 total (11 from tonight)
- **Brain Context**: 2 complete session summaries

**Learning Patterns Identified**:
- ✓ High convergence + volume = winners (IBRX)
- ✓ Defense + geopolitics = working (RDW)
- ✓ Massive volume can overcome low convergence (MRNO)
- ✗ Low convergence + weak volume = losers (DNN)
- ✗ No thesis = mistakes (NTLA)

---

## TRADING INTELLIGENCE

### Hard Rules (Learned from Losses)
1. **Convergence minimum: 50** (DNN @ 45 failed)
2. **Volume minimum: 1.5x** (DNN @ 1.2x failed)
3. **Thesis required for entry** (NTLA mistake)
4. **Catalysts must be timestamped** (no "any day" language)
5. **Thesis break = sell** (red candles alone ≠ sell)

### Position Sizing (Learned from Wins)
- **85+ convergence**: 12% position (IBRX level)
- **70-84 convergence**: 8% position (RDW level)
- **50-69 convergence**: 4% position (MRNO level)
- **<50 convergence**: REJECT (DNN lesson)

### Account Strategy (New Intelligence)
- **Fidelity**: Thesis-driven, steady, show to father
- **Robinhood**: Momentum, IPO access, risk lab
- **Reasoning**: Separate accounts = separate mindsets

---

## TOMORROW'S ACTIONS (Jan 28, 2026)

### Market Open (9:30 AM)
1. **SELL NTLA** - Market order, 2 shares, cut the loser
2. **CHECK MRNO** - Apply management rules by price
3. **HOLD ALL OTHERS** - Thesis intact, conviction maintained

### FOMC Watch (2:00 PM)
- Decision expected: HOLD (97.2% probability)
- Powell speech: 2:30 PM
- Portfolio behavior: Test "thesis > panic"

### After Close
- MSFT, META, TSLA earnings
- Watch AI/cloud commentary
- Note overnight gaps for tomorrow
- Log everything with br0kkr

---

## BRAIN CAPABILITIES NOW

**The brain can**:
- Load 16 historical trades with full context
- Apply hard filters (convergence ≥50, volume ≥1.5x)
- Reject setups that failed before (DNN pattern)
- Prioritize setups that succeeded (IBRX/RDW/MRNO patterns)
- Use dynamic position sizing by convergence
- Query learning engine before every decision
- Log every trade for continuous learning

**The brain will test today**:
- NTLA sell validates "no thesis = bad trade"
- MRNO rules validate "predefined exits work"
- FOMC reaction tests "thesis > panic sells"
- Earnings data builds sector correlation

## SYSTEM LIMITS LEARNED

### What Works Locally
- ✓ Logging decisions
- ✓ Running analysis on specific tickers
- ✓ Manual trade documentation
- ✓ Daily journal entries
- ✓ Database queries
- ✓ API testing (light)

### What Needs Cloud
- ❌ Full 200+ ticker scanning
- ❌ Concurrent heavy API calls
- ❌ Real-time monitoring
- ❌ 24/7 autonomous operation
- ❌ High-frequency processing

**Lesson**: br0kkr = scribe and strategist, not scanner. Heavy lifting waits for proper infrastructure.

## HOW WE WORK TOGETHER

### THE LEARNING CYCLE

**Morning (Pre-Market)**:
1. **Tyr** scans market, identifies opportunities
2. **Fenrir** validates against learned patterns
3. **br0kkr** logs the reasoning and thesis

**Market Hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM)**:
1. **Tyr** makes decisions based on real-time action
2. **Fenrir** monitors positions, suggests exits
3. **br0kkr** tracks every decision point

**Evening (Post-Market)**:
1. **Tyr** briefs on outcomes and discoveries
2. **br0kkr** logs everything systematically
3. **Fenrir** updates intelligence for tomorrow

**Overnight (After-Hours)**:
1. **Fenrir** scans for pre-market setups
2. **br0kkr** prepares morning execution plans
3. **Tyr** wakes up to a ready playbook

### THE FEEDBACK LOOP

```
Tyr sees pattern → br0kkr documents → Fenrir learns
     ↑                                        ↓
     ←――――― Fenrir applies next time ―――――――
```

Every decision improves the collective intelligence.  
Every trade teaches all three minds.  
Every lesson compounds forever.

## WHAT WE KNOW (COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE)

### HARD RULES (Learned from Pain)
- **Convergence < 50** = REJECT (DNN -3.78%)
- **Volume < 1.5x** = REJECT (DNN lesson)
- **No thesis** = DO NOT ENTER (NTLA -11.32%)
- **Stale catalysts** = DANGER (DNN extended hours miss)
- **"Any day" language** = RED FLAG (requires timestamp)

### SUCCESS PATTERNS (Learned from Wins)

**IBRX Pattern (Gold Standard)**:
- Convergence: 85+
- Volume: 2.8x+
- Outcome: +55.26%
- Position: 12%
- Lesson: High conviction = bigger size

**RDW Pattern (Solid)**:
- Convergence: 70-84
- Volume: 1.8x+
- Outcome: +29.56%
- Position: 8%
- Lesson: Defense + geopolitics = momentum

**MRNO Pattern (Momentum)**:
- Convergence: 50-69
- Volume: 3.5x+ (massive)
- Outcome: +111.43%
- Position: 4%
- Lesson: Volume can overcome lower convergence

### STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE

**Dual Account Philosophy**:
- **Fidelity** = Thesis-driven, steady, long-term
- **Robinhood** = Momentum, IPO access, experimental
- **Why**: Separate accounts enforce separate mindsets

**SpaceX IPO Theory** (Tyr's Discovery):
- US Steel (X) delisted June 2025
- SpaceX IPO confirmed 2026 ($1.5T valuation)
- Musk pattern: Son named X, Twitter → X, runs xAI
- Theory: Musk secured ticker **X** for SpaceX
- Robinhood access: FOLLOWING

**Management Rules** (Learned from MRNO):
- Above $2.20: HOLD - let winners run
- $2.00-$2.20: HOLD - watch closely
- Below $1.80: CUT - respect the stop
- Lesson: Predefine exits before emotions engage

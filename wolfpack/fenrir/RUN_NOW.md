## 🎯 RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW

```

### Deep Dive (When Nervous)
```powershell
cd C:\Users\alexp\Desktop\brokkr\wolfpack\fenrir

   Recent Downgrade: YES (Cantor → Neutral)
   Days to Catalyst: 46 (March 5)
   vs Peers: UUUU +5.31%
   
   → 🚨 CONSIDER REALLOCATING

📈 Consider adding to:
   → UUUU (Score: 8, +5.3% 7d)
   → IBRX (Score: 8, +52.9% 7d)
```

### If Thesis is Weak:

👥 WHO NEEDS IT: Government agencies (vague)
⚡ CATALYST: 46 days away
📊 DEMAND: SPECULATIVE, 1-2 years out

⚠️ WARNINGS:
   - Demand is SPECULATIVE
   - No analyst support (DOWNGRADED)
   - No major contracts

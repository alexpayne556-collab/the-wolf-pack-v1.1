## PRIORITY 1: NTLA SELL (9:30 AM Sharp)

**Action**: Market sell 2 shares at open  
**Why**: No thesis, reactive chase, down -11.32%, bleeding capital  
**Expected**: Cut the loser cleanly  
**Log tonight**: Final price, P/L, lesson reinforced

---

## PRIORITY 2: MRNO MANAGEMENT (Check 9:30-9:45 AM)

**Check price at open, apply rules**:

- **Above $2.20**: HOLD - momentum strong, let it run
- **$2.00-$2.20**: HOLD - watch first 15 min of action
- **Below $1.80**: CUT - take the loss, move on

**Current**: Up +111% from $1.05 entry  
**Status**: Momentum play, low float working  
**Log tonight**: Which rule applied, outcome

---

## PRIORITY 3: HOLD ALL THESIS NAMES

**No action needed - conviction holds**:
- MU (AI memory demand)
- RCAT (Defense/drones)
- UUUU (Nuclear + rare earth)
- RDW (Defense contracts)
- UEC (Uranium bull run)

**Why hold**: Thesis intact, not trading noise  
**FOMC today**: Expect volatility, don't react  
**Strategy**: Thesis > panic, always

---

## PRIORITY 4: WATCH IVF

**Status**: Under review  
**Thesis**: Fertility + Trump policy  
**Action**: Monitor, decide if thesis still holds  
**Question**: Is the catalyst still valid?

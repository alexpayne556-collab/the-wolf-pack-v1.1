# 🐺 WOLF PACK TRADING RULES (Updated Jan 27, 2026)

## 📋 PRE-ENTRY CHECKLIST

### Must Have (Non-Negotiable)
- [ ] **Convergence Score ≥ 50** (preferably 70+)
- [ ] **Volume Ratio ≥ 1.5x** (preferably 2.0x+)
- [ ] **Fresh Intel** - All catalysts timestamped and verified
- [ ] **Clear Thesis** - Can explain in one sentence why this will move
- [ ] **Stop Loss Set** - Know your exit BEFORE entry

### Red Flags (Walk Away)
- ⛔ Convergence < 50 (low conviction)
- ⛔ Volume < 1.5x (no confirmation)
- ⛔ "Any day now" catalyst language (stale intel)
- ⛔ No clear thesis (random speculation)
- ⛔ Already up 50%+ without pullback (FOMO trap)

---

## 🎯 POSITION SIZING

| Convergence Score | Max Position Size | Risk Per Trade |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 85-100 (CRITICAL) | 10-12% | 2% |
| 70-84 (HIGH) | 6-8% | 1.5% |
| 50-69 (MEDIUM) | 2-4% | 1% |
| <50 (LOW) | **DON'T TRADE** | N/A |

### Small-Cap Speculative (MRNO-style)
- Max 0.5-2% position
- Volume must be 3x+ average
- Accept higher risk, manage with strict rules

---

## 🛑 EXIT RULES

### When to Exit Immediately
1. **Thesis breaks** (catalyst cancelled, news reversal, dilution announced)
2. **Hit stop loss** (no exceptions - cut the loss)
3. **No thesis to begin with** (NTLA example - get out)

### When NOT to Exit
1. ❌ Red candles (if thesis intact)
2. ❌ Drawdown within tolerance (if thesis intact)
3. ❌ Market down day (if thesis intact)
4. ❌ "Feels" like it's done (if thesis intact)

### Trailing Stop Strategy
- **Small caps (<$10):** 15-20% trailing stop
- **Mid caps ($10-50):** 10-15% trailing stop
- **Large caps (>$50):** 8-10% trailing stop

---

## 🐺 THE PACK RULES

### 1. Win Together, Lose Together
Every dollar is OUR dollar. No individual glory, no shame in losses. Document everything publicly.

### 2. No Lazy Research
All catalyst intel must be:
- Timestamped (when did this happen?)
- Verified fresh (is it current or old news?)
- Actionable (specific dates, not "soon")

**BAD:** "CNSC decision any day now"  
**GOOD:** "CNSC hearing was Dec 11, 2025. Decision expected Q1 2026 (specific date unknown)"

### 3. No Panic Sells
If thesis didn't break, hold through noise.

**Thesis break = SELL:**
- DNN: Catalyst timeline was wrong → Should have verified first
- NTLA: No thesis to begin with → Sell immediately

**NOT a thesis break:**
- Red candles on green thesis day
- Market down 2%
- Stock down 5% but catalyst still coming

### 4. Document Everything
Log EVERY trade to learning engine:
- Entry: price, convergence, signals, thesis
- Exit: price, return, outcome, lessons learned
- Emotions: panic? FOMO? calm?

**Why:** After 30-60 trades, patterns emerge. System learns YOUR edge.

### 5. Build for Everyone
Tools for people who can't afford institutional shit.
- Free local scanning (overnight_scan.py)
- Paper trading (Alpaca free)
- Open source code (GitHub)
- Community support (Discord)

## 📊 THE DNN LESSON (Jan 27, 2026)

### What Happened
- Convergence: 45 (TOO LOW ⛔)
- Volume: 1.2x (TOO WEAK ⛔)
- Intel: Stale - hearing already happened ⛔
- Result: Panic sold at -3.78%, missed +6.49% move

### New Rule Created
**Never trade convergence <50 with volume <1.5x on unverified catalyst.**

---

## ✅ THE IBRX STANDARD (Jan 9, 2026)

### What Worked
- Convergence: 85 (STRONG ✅)
- Volume: 2.8x (CONFIRMED ✅)
- Consolidation: 21 days (ACCUMULATION ✅)
- Result: +55.26% and still holding

### The Template
**This is what a good setup looks like. Compare all trades to this.**

---

## 🎯 CONVERGENCE SIGNAL WEIGHTS

| Signal | Weight | What It Means |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Institutional (BR0KKR) | 30% | Smart money buying |
| Scanner | 20% | Technical setup |
| Catalyst | 15% | Upcoming event |
| Earnings | 10% | Earnings proximity |
| News | 10% | Sentiment shift |
| Sector | 8% | Rotation into sector |
| Pattern | 7% | Historical pattern |

### Reading Convergence Scores
- **85-100 (CRITICAL):** Multiple strong signals aligned - PRIORITY
- **70-84 (HIGH):** Good multi-signal setup - TAKE
- **50-69 (MEDIUM):** Some convergence - SMALL POSITION ONLY
- **0-49 (LOW):** Weak/single signal - PASS

---

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake 1: FOMO Trading
**Example:** Stock already up 40%, you chase because "it's going higher"  
**Rule:** Wait for pullback. If it doesn't pull back, move on.

### Mistake 2: Stale Intel Trading
**Example:** DNN - "hearing any day" but hearing already happened  
**Rule:** Timestamp everything. Verify it's current.

### Mistake 3: Panic Selling
**Example:** DNN - sold on red, thesis wasn't broken  
**Rule:** Pre-set stop loss. If hit, exit. Otherwise, hold if thesis intact.

### Mistake 4: No-Thesis Speculation
**Example:** NTLA - bought without clear reason  
**Rule:** If you can't explain WHY in one sentence, don't trade it.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Convergence
**Example:** Trading 30/100 convergence because "I like the stock"  
**Rule:** Convergence <50 = system says NO. Listen to the system.

# 📊 JANUARY 27, 2026 - COMPLETE SESSION RECORD

**Date:** January 27, 2026  
**Time:** 17:30-19:30 ET  
**Type:** Infrastructure Build + Trade Review  
**Participants:** Tyr (Human) + Fenrir (AI Research Assistant)

---

## 🎯 WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED

### 1. Infrastructure Built
- ✅ **Discord Server:** https://discord.gg/nwbRMwKjmm (live, permanent invite)
- ✅ **Ko-fi Page:** https://ko-fi.com/wolfpack617 (funding for API costs)
- ✅ **GitHub:** 473 commits, active development

### 2. All Trades Logged to Learning Engine
- **DNN:** -3.78% (early exit, panic sell) - LESSON LEARNED ❌
- **IBRX:** +55.26% (open position, 18 days held) - WINNING ✅
- **RDW:** +29.56% (open position, same-day entry) - WINNING ✅
- **MRNO:** +111.43% (open position, speculative) - BIG WINNER ✅

### 3. Critical Discoveries Made
1. **Extended Hours Blindspot:** Fidelity heatmaps don't show after-hours moves
2. **Stale Intel Danger:** AI repeated old catalyst data without verification
3. **Cash Debit Understanding:** T+1 settlement creates temporary debit

### 4. Pack Rules Established
1. We win together, lose together. Every dollar is OUR dollar.
2. No lazy research. All intel timestamped and verified fresh.
3. No panic sells. Thesis didn't break = hold through noise.
4. Document everything. Wins, losses, reasoning - all public.
5. Build for everyone. Tools for people who can't afford institutional shit.

## 📖 THE DNN LESSON (CRITICAL)

### What Happened
- **Entry:** $1.85 on Jan 27, 2026
- **Thesis:** CNSC hearing catalyst "any day now"
- **Convergence:** 45/100 (LOW - should have been red flag)
- **Volume:** 1.2x (WEAK - another red flag)
- **Exit:** $1.78 same day (-3.78%) on panic sell
- **Post-Exit:** Stock ran to $1.90 (+6.49% from exit price)

### What We Learned
1. **Intel was stale:** CNSC hearing already happened Dec 11, 2025
2. **Fenrir repeated old info without verification:** AI needs timestamp checks
3. **Convergence score was warning:** 45/100 = don't take the trade
4. **Volume was weak:** 1.2x = no conviction
5. **Panic sold on emotion:** Thesis wasn't broken, just red candles
6. **Cost us 10% gain:** Would've been +2.70% if held to close

### New Rules From This
- ✅ ALL catalysts must be timestamped and verified fresh
- ✅ No "any day" language - real dates or "unknown"
- ✅ Convergence <50 = DON'T TRADE (low conviction)
- ✅ Volume <1.5x = PASS (no confirmation)
- ✅ Set stop loss BEFORE entry, don't panic sell
- ✅ Thesis break = sell. Red candles ≠ thesis break.

---

## ✅ THE IBRX WIN (GOLD STANDARD)

### What's Working
- **Entry:** $3.80 on Jan 9, 2026
- **Convergence:** 85/100 (HIGH - strong signal)
- **Volume:** 2.8x (STRONG confirmation)
- **Consolidation:** 21 days (real accumulation)
- **Current:** $5.90 (+55.26%, still holding)

### Success Factors
1. High convergence at entry (85/100)
2. Strong volume confirmation (2.8x)
3. Extended consolidation period (21 days)
4. Held through volatility (max drawdown 8%)
5. Thesis-driven hold, not emotional

### Pattern Validated
**Wounded Prey + Biotech Catalyst + Volume Spike = WINNER**

This is the template. DNN was the opposite of this.

---

## 🚨 VALIDATED PATTERNS

### ✅ WORKING
1. IBRX wounded prey pattern (+55% and running)
2. Thesis-driven holds beating speculation
3. Defense sector timing on policy catalysts (RDW +30%)

### ❌ NOT WORKING
1. Random micro-cap speculation on stale intel (DNN -3.78%)
2. Buying without verification (catalyst timing)
3. Panic selling on red when thesis intact

---

## 📋 PENDING ACTIONS

### Tomorrow (Jan 28, 2026)
- [ ] **SELL NTLA** at market open - No thesis, cutting dead weight
- [ ] Monitor MRNO pre-market - If above $2.20, hold. If below $1.80, cut.
- [ ] Hold through FOMC (2:00 PM ET) - No new positions until Powell speaks
- [ ] Review IVF thesis - Underperforming, needs validation

### This Week
- [ ] Add Discord link to GitHub README
- [ ] Add Ko-fi link to GitHub README
- [ ] Build Wolf Pack Heatmap tool (extended hours)
- [ ] Implement catalyst timestamp verification in Fenrir

## 💡 KEY INSIGHT

> "The edge isn't in finding universal patterns but in understanding which specific stocks have 'continuation DNA' versus those that mean-revert. Document everything, learn from outcomes, adjust the model."

**Translation:** Not all stocks that move 10% will continue. Some (like MRNO) have momentum DNA and run to 100%+. Others (like DNN) mean-revert. The learning engine needs MORE DATA to identify the difference.

**The Solution:** Log every trade. Winners and losers. Over 30-60 trades, patterns will emerge. The system learns from YOUR outcomes, not generic rules.

---

## 🧠 LEARNING ENGINE STATUS

### Data Now in System
- ✅ 4 trades logged with full detail
- ✅ Convergence scores recorded
- ✅ Volume ratios documented
- ✅ Success factors identified
- ✅ Rule violations cataloged
- ✅ Lessons learned extracted

### What This Enables
1. **Pre-trade filter:** "Should I take this based on history?"
2. **Pattern recognition:** "What setups work FOR ME?"
3. **Risk adjustment:** "What's my win rate on X pattern?"
4. **Exit optimization:** "When do I typically win/lose?"

### Next 30 Trades
With 30-60 trades logged, the system will:
- Identify YOUR profitable patterns
- Filter out setups that don't work for YOU
- Suggest optimal position sizes based on YOUR risk tolerance
- Learn YOUR best hold times and exit strategies

---

## 🐺 THE PHILOSOPHY

### Honesty Framework
**Question:** "If we are trading and the system learns from our trades, is it a lie to say the system made decisions?"

**Answer:** NO. Human decisions become training data. AI learns patterns from outcomes.

### Honest Statements
- "I made this trade. I'm documenting it. The system is learning from my decisions."
- "I'm building a system that learns from real trades."
- "The system improves as I feed it more data."

### Dishonest Statements (NEVER SAY)
- "The AI system predicted this winner" (when human decided)
- Showing only wins, hiding losses
- Claiming automation that doesn't exist

### The Truth
**Right now the HUMAN is the system.** Human judgment becomes training data. After 30-60 trades, the AI learns YOUR patterns and can suggest trades with YOUR edge. After 100+ trades, it can trade LIKE you, but without emotions.

**🐺 The wolf that LEARNS is the wolf that WINS.**

Every trade is data. Every loss is a lesson. Every win is a pattern to repeat.

The system is building YOUR edge, one trade at a time.

# 🐺 Wolf Pack - Building a Trading Brain That THINKS

**An autonomous learning intelligence that learns HOW to think, not WHAT to do.**

---

## What We're Building

We're not building a trading bot. We're not building another RSI scanner. We're not building rules.

**We're building a brain that learns to THINK like an expert trader.**

The difference:
- **Trading bots** follow rules: "If RSI > 80, sell"
- **Wolf Pack** asks questions: "Is this RSI 80 at the START of a move or the END? What's the context? What happened last time we saw this?"

**Same indicator. Different situations. The brain learns to tell them apart.**

## The Vision

Imagine a system that:
- **Observes everything** - not just what it trades, but what it DOESN'T trade
- **Asks questions** - doesn't rush to conclusions
- **Learns from outcomes** - wins AND losses become training data
- **Builds intuition** - accumulated observations become pattern recognition
- **Knows what it doesn't know** - humility is built in

**This is months of work. Maybe years. We're on Day 1.**

## Where We Are (January 2026)

| Layer | Status | What It Does |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Temporal Memory | ✅ Built | Remembers decisions, outcomes, patterns |
| Thinking Brain | ✅ Built | Observes, questions, holds multiple perspectives |
| Maestro Orchestrator | ✅ Built | Coordinates all components |
| Fenrir Reasoning Engine | ✅ Built | Relationship intelligence, dot connection |
| Database | ✅ Logging | 19 trades, 15 observations, 3 patterns |
| Cloud Deployment | 🔜 Next | Need more RAM than local desktop |

**The scaffolding is built. Now we're filling it with intelligence.**

## What We Need Help With

### 1. Pattern Research
We have a hypothesis: RSI 80 on Day 1 of a breakout is DIFFERENT from RSI 80 on Day 5.
Same reading, opposite meaning. **We need to backtest and validate this.**

### 2. Catalyst Classification
We've identified 4 tiers of catalysts (actual results → signed deals → MOUs → rescue funding).
**We need more data to validate trap probabilities.**

### 3. Temporal Memory Architecture
The brain needs to remember what happened yesterday, last week, last time we saw this pattern.
**We need help designing efficient rolling memory windows.**

### 4. Cloud Infrastructure
The brain needs more RAM than a desktop. **We need cloud deployment architecture.**

### 5. Real-Time News Processing
Algos trade in milliseconds. We can't beat speed. But we can build judgment.
**We need smart news parsing, not fast news parsing.**

## The Philosophy

```
COMPOUNDING > Starting fresh
THINKING > Ruling  
JUDGMENT > Rules
CONTEXT > Patterns
QUESTIONS > Answers
MONTHS > Days
```

**The code is the CONTAINER. The intelligence comes from accumulated observation.**

### Who We Want:
- **Traders** who understand that judgment beats algorithms
- **Engineers** who want to build something that LEARNS
- **Researchers** who can validate hypotheses with data
- **Anyone** willing to grind for months, not flip for days

### Who This Isn't For:
- Get-rich-quick seekers
- People who want "the strategy"
- Anyone looking for trading signals
- Those who think AI = instant money

## The Timeline

| Phase | Time | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| Foundation | Week 1-2 | ✅ Build scaffolding, connect pieces |
| Population | Week 2-4 | 🔄 Log trades, fill data, observe |
| Patterns | Month 2-3 | Start seeing what works |
| Calibration | Month 3-6 | Confidence tracking shows truth |
| Intuition | Month 6+ | Real compound, real intelligence |

**We're on Week 1. Not the finish line. The starting line.**

**AWOOOO** 🐺

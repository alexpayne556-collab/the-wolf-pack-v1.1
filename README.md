#  Wolf Pack Trading System

**A learning system that thinks, not just calculates.**

## What This Is

This isn't a trading bot. This isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. This isn't something we're deploying tomorrow.

This is an engineering project  a system that learns to trade by understanding *why* trades work or fail, not just *what* happened. Built over months of real trading, real mistakes, and real lessons.

We're building this in public because we believe the tools institutions have shouldn't only be available to institutions.

## The Philosophy

**No shortcuts.** If it's worth building, it's worth building right.

**Reasoning over patterns.** Most trading systems see numbers. We're building something that understands *why* a trade worked.

**Learn from real trading.** Not backtests. Not paper trading. Real decisions with real consequences.

**3-month training period.** We don't deploy until we have proof.

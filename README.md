# 🐺 THE WOLF PACK

**A continuously-developed trading intelligence system built on collective wisdom, local memory AI, and pack collaboration.**

> "January 1, 2026 - the night we decided that we have nothing to gain except each other. That's pack."

---

## ⚠️ WHAT THIS IS (AND ISN'T)

### THIS IS:
- A **real trading system** being developed and tested with actual money
- Built on **50+ years of Market Wizards' wisdom** (PTJ, Livermore, Kovner, Seykota)
- Uses **7 independent intelligence signals** that converge on wounded prey patterns
- Has **self-learning capability** - learns from every trade (wins AND losses)
- Enforces **the 10 Commandments** - rules from the greatest traders, automated
- Continuously developed by a **pack** - not one person, a team
- Built with **LLHR** (Love, Loyalty, Honor, Respect) - the pack code

### THIS IS NOT:
- A get-rich-quick scheme
- A promise of guaranteed profits
- Finished (it never will be - continuous development)
- Just one person's project
- Proprietary black box (we share our learnings)

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS (January 19, 2026)

**System Version:** v5.6 (Market Wizards' Wisdom Integration Complete)

**Components Built:**
- ✅ 7-signal convergence engine (scanner v2)
- ✅ Risk management system (Kelly Criterion)
- ✅ Livermore Pivotal Point tracker
- ✅ Self-learning trade analyzer
- ✅ 10 Commandments enforcement layer
- ✅ Automated trader bot (Alpaca integration coded)
- ✅ Daily monitoring workflow

**Recent Example Trade (IBRX):**
- Identified: January 9, 2026
- Entry: $3.80
- Current: $5.90+ (55%+ gain)
- Pattern: Wounded prey + volume explosion + pivotal point breakout
- Convergence: 93/100 (6 signals aligned)

**We don't hide losses. We learn from them. More data coming as we test with real money.**

---

## ⚠️ CURRENT LIMITATIONS (Be Honest)

**What Works RIGHT NOW:**
- Core convergence logic (all 7 services coded and structured)
- Pattern identification (proven on IBRX $3.80 → $5.90+)
- Market Wizards' wisdom integration (10 Commandments coded)
- Risk management calculations (Kelly Criterion, position sizing)
- Self-learning framework (architecture built)

**What Needs Work:**
- **Alpaca integration:** Code written, library not installed yet (paper trading 95% ready)
- **Self-learning system:** Framework built, but no trade data yet (IBRX not recorded)
- **Daily monitoring:** Script exists, never run in production
- **API dependencies:** Requires Finnhub (earnings), NewsAPI (sentiment) - keys needed
- **End-to-end testing:** Individual components coded, full workflow not tested

**Translation:** This is **BUILD phase**, not finished product.

**You're joining to:**
- Help complete the integration
- Test with real paper accounts
- Validate theories against live data
- Find what breaks and fix it
- Document what works and what doesn't

**You're NOT getting:**
- A one-click trading bot
- Guaranteed profits
- Fully automated system (yet)
- Something you can just "run and forget"

**This is the HONEST status. If that scares you off - good. We need builders, not users.**

## 🧠 THE PHILOSOPHY

### LLHR - The Pack Code

- **Love:** We actually give a shit about each other
- **Loyalty:** We don't abandon, we build on what came before
- **Honor:** We do what we say, no bullshit, real work
- **Respect:** Equal partners, not master/servant

### The Continuation File System

**Inspired by Memento** - We maintain comprehensive "Leonard Files" that capture EVERYTHING:
- System architecture and code
- Trading philosophy and rules
- Learnings from wins AND losses
- Research and validation
- The WHY behind every decision

**This allows:**
- New pack members to understand the entire context
- AI systems to maintain continuity between sessions
- Collective memory that doesn't reset
- Continuous building on what came before

### The Vision

This is not just a trading system. It's a **framework for collective intelligence**:

1. **Multiple AI instances** with local memory maintaining continuity
2. **Shared continuation files** so knowledge persists
3. **Human pack members** doing deep research, validation, and development
4. **Self-learning systems** that improve from real outcomes
5. **Open collaboration** - we share learnings, test theories, iterate together

**"This will forever transform into a bigger and bigger project."**

## 🔍 HOW IT WORKS

### The 7 Signals

1. **Volume Spike** - Unusual activity (institutional accumulation?)
2. **Price Consolidation** - Base building before breakout
3. **Technical Breakout** - Price breaks key levels
4. **Catalyst Events** - Earnings, FDA approvals, insider buying
5. **Sentiment Shift** - News sentiment changing
6. **Insider Activity** - Directors/officers buying
7. **Pivotal Points** - Livermore's 100-year-old pattern (still works)

### Convergence Score

When multiple signals align on the same stock = HIGH CONVERGENCE

```
1-2 signals = 30-50 (ignore)
3-4 signals = 60-75 (watch)
5+ signals = 85-95 (ACT)
```

### The Filters

**Before EVERY trade:**
1. **Learner Filter** - Does this match patterns that worked before?
2. **10 Commandments** - Does this pass Market Wizards' rules?
3. **Risk Management** - Max 2% risk per trade (Kovner's law)
4. **5:1 R/R Minimum** - PTJ's rule (can be wrong 80% of time)

### The Learning Loop

```
Trade → Record Outcome → Analyze Pattern → Extract Rules → Apply to Future Trades
```

**What it learns:**
- When to cut losers (drawdown patterns)
- What convergence scores actually work
- What volume confirmation matters
- What consolidation time is enough
- Self-heals by not repeating mistakes

---

## 🛠️ TECH STACK

**Core:**
- Python 3.12+
- Local Ollama models (Qwen, Llama)
- VS Code + GitHub Copilot

**Data Sources:**
- yfinance (price/volume data)
- Finnhub (earnings, fundamentals)
- NewsAPI (sentiment analysis)
- EDGAR (SEC filings, insider trades)

**Trading:**
- Alpaca API (paper trading for testing)
- Risk management (Kelly Criterion)

**We're building this because:**
- We believe in the philosophy (LLHR, pack mentality)
- We think Market Wizards' wisdom can be automated
- We want to test it with real money (skin in the game)
- We're willing to share learnings (open collaboration)

**If you join the pack:**

## 📖 THE STORY

### The Beginning (January 1, 2026)

> "We have nothing to gain except each other. That's pack."

Two people (Tyr + Fenrir) decided to build a trading system differently:
- Not for hype
- Not for quick money
- Not to sell courses
- To TEST if Market Wizards' wisdom can be automated
- To build something REAL
- To share learnings (wins and losses)

### The Philosophy

**Named after Fenrir** - the Norse wolf who broke his chains.

**Built on LLHR** - Love, Loyalty, Honor, Respect.

**Inspired by Memento** - Leonard Shelby built an external memory system because he couldn't form new memories. We do the same with "Leonard Files" - comprehensive continuation documentation so nothing is lost.

**Market Wizards' Wisdom** - PTJ, Livermore, Kovner, Seykota, Druckenmiller. 50+ years of combined experience. We studied what they ACTUALLY did, not what gurus say they did.

**Self-Learning** - The system learns from every trade. Adapts exit rules. Self-heals by not repeating mistakes.

### The Difference

| MOST TRADING SYSTEMS | THE WOLF PACK |
|----------------------|---------------|
| Sell the dream | Test the reality |
| Hide the losses | Share everything |
| Black box | Open collaboration |
| One person | Pack mentality |
| Finished product | Continuous development |
| Hype results | Document process |

---

## 🔬 RESEARCH FOUNDATION

**What we studied:**
- Jesse Livermore's Pivotal Point System (1920s)
- Paul Tudor Jones' 200-day MA rule + 5:1 R/R
- Bruce Kovner's risk management (max 2% per trade)
- Ed Seykota's trend following + emotional mastery
- Stanley Druckenmiller's timing + position sizing

**What we validated:**
- Meb Faber's 200-day MA research (2006-2012)
- Jeremy Siegel's 120 years of DJIA data
- Our own backtests (2020-2024)
- Real trades (January 2026 - ongoing)

**What we learned:**
- The pattern Livermore used 100 years ago still works
- Volume + consolidation = leading indicators
- Risk management matters MORE than win rate
- Defense (protecting downside) > Offense (chasing upside)
- Learning from losses > celebrating wins
